        desc: "Is there such a thing as average dog weight? According to Purina's experts, an average weight or range will vary from breed to breed and even between males and females. Learn why here, along with what they suggest using instead.",
        longDesc: "Since dogs come in so many different breeds and sizes, itâ€™s impossible to identify an average weight for all dogs. Weight may also depend on the dog's sex and whether they've been spayed or neutered. Although many resources provide an average weight range for different breeds, it's usually significant. These ranges often don't take the dog's sex and other factors into consideration."

        longDesc: "You may have expected this list to start with a product like a dog seat belt, but extensive training is crucial. A well-trained dog will cause fewer distractions in the car, which significantly reduces the risk of an accident. Whether your dog is scared of car rides or gets overly excited about getting in a vehicle, start with slow, gradual training. Get him used to getting in and out of the car, the sounds of the doors, the engine and the horn."
